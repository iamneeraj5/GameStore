<h2>Super Mario Bros Nintendo Game From 1985 Sold for $2 Million in a New Record</h2>
<img src="C2.jpg" width="550" height="350">
<p id="p2">An anonymous buyer has paid $2 million (roughly Rs. 14.84 crores) to buy an unopened copy of Super Mario Bros, a game that had become wildly popular at the turn of this century and still commands a dedicated following.
</p>
<p>The astonishing sale price of the 1985 game intended for Nintendo's original console broke a record that was set just a month ago when a sealed copy of Super Mario 64 was auctioned for $1.56 million (roughly Rs. 11.58 crores). The latest record is the highest price paid for a video game of any title, according to collectibles website Rally.
</p>
<p>The record for the most expensive video games has been broken several times over the past year. In July last year, a copy of Super Mario had sold for $114,000 (Rs. 84.65 lakhs) at an auction. In November, another copy was auctioned for $156,000 (Rs. 1.15 crores). That record was broken in April this year at $660,000 (Rs. 4.90 crores).
</p>
<p id="p3">The New York Times, which first reported the record sale price, said Rally had bought the Super Mario 1985 game in April last year for $140,000 (Rs. 1.03 crores). It also reported that investors had passed on a $300,000 (Rs. 2.22 crores) offer later in 2020. A graduate student who spoke to the publication said he invested $100 (Rs. 7,423) in shares of the game and made $950 (Rs. 70,518) from the sale.
