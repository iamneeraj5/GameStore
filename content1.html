<h2>NASCAR comes back to console video games, with the Unreal Engine</h2>
<img src="C1.jpg" width="700" height="350">
<p id="p2">NASCAR 21: Ignition, made in Unreal 4, will launch Oct. 28 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. It's the second NASCAR title published by new label Motorsport Games, a subsidiary of the global media company Motorsport Network.
</p>
<p>"It's a product that we've been building for over two years; it is a built-from-scratch product,"  
	Dmitry Kozko, Motorsport Games' chief executive, told Polygon in an interview.
</p>
<p>The NASCAR Heat series, spanning 2016 to 2020, was built in the Unity engine, which gave its components a no-frills look. NASCAR 21: Ignition "has none of the Unity components," Kozko said. 
"It has probably nothing except some concepts from the previous games that 704 Games published." 
</p>
<p id="p3">Given the spotty history of NASCAR as a video games license in the two console generations since EA Sports walked away, Motorsport's move is an unexpected doubling down. Kozko bluntly acknowledged that the preceding series "doesn't compare to the modern triple-A [development] standards. â€¦ I don't know why nobody has come around to make the proper investment to create that type of title, but I'm glad to be the one for the next decade with our licenses.
