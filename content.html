<h2>NASCAR comes back to console video games, with the Unreal Engine</h2>
<img src="C1.jpg" width="700" height="350">
<p id="p2">NASCAR 21: Ignition, made in Unreal 4, will launch Oct. 28 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. It's the second NASCAR title published by new label Motorsport Games, a subsidiary of the global media company Motorsport Network.
</p>
<p>"It's a product that we've been building for over two years; it is a built-from-scratch product,"  
	Dmitry Kozko, Motorsport Games' chief executive, told Polygon in an interview.
</p>
<p>The NASCAR Heat series, spanning 2016 to 2020, was built in the Unity engine, which gave its components a no-frills look. NASCAR 21: Ignition "has none of the Unity components," Kozko said. 
"It has probably nothing except some concepts from the previous games that 704 Games published." 
</p>
<p id="p3">Given the spotty history of NASCAR as a video games license in the two console generations since EA Sports walked away, Motorsport's move is an unexpected doubling down. Kozko bluntly acknowledged that the preceding series "doesn't compare to the modern triple-A [development] standards. â€¦ I don't know why nobody has come around to make the proper investment to create that type of title, but I'm glad to be the one for the next decade with our licenses.

<h2>Super Mario Bros Nintendo Game From 1985 Sold for $2 Million in a New Record</h2>
<img src="C2.jpg" width="550" height="350">
<p id="p2">An anonymous buyer has paid $2 million (roughly Rs. 14.84 crores) to buy an unopened copy of Super Mario Bros, a game that had become wildly popular at the turn of this century and still commands a dedicated following.
</p>
<p>The astonishing sale price of the 1985 game intended for Nintendo's original console broke a record that was set just a month ago when a sealed copy of Super Mario 64 was auctioned for $1.56 million (roughly Rs. 11.58 crores). The latest record is the highest price paid for a video game of any title, according to collectibles website Rally.
</p>
<p>The record for the most expensive video games has been broken several times over the past year. In July last year, a copy of Super Mario had sold for $114,000 (Rs. 84.65 lakhs) at an auction. In November, another copy was auctioned for $156,000 (Rs. 1.15 crores). That record was broken in April this year at $660,000 (Rs. 4.90 crores).
</p>
<p id="p3">The New York Times, which first reported the record sale price, said Rally had bought the Super Mario 1985 game in April last year for $140,000 (Rs. 1.03 crores). It also reported that investors had passed on a $300,000 (Rs. 2.22 crores) offer later in 2020. A graduate student who spoke to the publication said he invested $100 (Rs. 7,423) in shares of the game and made $950 (Rs. 70,518) from the sale.

<h2>NETFLIX to launch video games for no extra charge</h2>
<img src="C3.png" width="550" height="350">
<p id="p2">Netflix reported its worst slowdown in subscriber growth in eight years as people emerged from their pandemic cocoons. But it has an answer to that: Video games.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the streaming giant announced plans to begin adding video games to its existing subscription plans at no extra cost. It didn't release details except to note that it will initially focus on mobile games.
</p>
<p>That financial breakdown showed the video service added 1.5 million subscribers during the April-June period. That's slightly better than the modest increase that management forecast after the service stumbled to a sluggish start during the winter months, but still far below its growth rate in recent years.
</p>
<p id="p3">"We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV," Netflix wrote in a Tuesday letter to shareholders.<br>
Despite this year's growth slowdown, Netflix remains by far the world's biggest streaming service in an increasingly competitive field that includes Walt Disney Co., HBO, Amazon and Apple. Netflix finished June with 209 million worldwide subscribers.
