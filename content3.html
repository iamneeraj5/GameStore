<h2>NETFLIX to launch video games for no extra charge</h2>
<img src="C3.png" width="550" height="350">
<p id="p2">Netflix reported its worst slowdown in subscriber growth in eight years as people emerged from their pandemic cocoons. But it has an answer to that: Video games.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the streaming giant announced plans to begin adding video games to its existing subscription plans at no extra cost. It didn't release details except to note that it will initially focus on mobile games.
</p>
<p>That financial breakdown showed the video service added 1.5 million subscribers during the April-June period. That's slightly better than the modest increase that management forecast after the service stumbled to a sluggish start during the winter months, but still far below its growth rate in recent years.
</p>
<p id="p3">"We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV," Netflix wrote in a Tuesday letter to shareholders.<br>
Despite this year's growth slowdown, Netflix remains by far the world's biggest streaming service in an increasingly competitive field that includes Walt Disney Co., HBO, Amazon and Apple. Netflix finished June with 209 million worldwide subscribers.
